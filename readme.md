## Week 1
The first (optional) [assignment](https://github.com/Rusty-Almond/WebScraping2k25-assignments/blob/main/problem1.ipynb) was to make a neural network to identify the digits from the mnist database. 

## Week 2
There were 2 problems for week 2
### Problem 1
Given the 2011 census data perform the following tasks:
#### Task 1
1. Show how literacy rate for males, females, and the total population differs between urban and rural areas within each state.
2. Which state has the highest disparity between urban and rural areas?
3. Also plot 2 graphs for male and female population showing combined literacy rates for each state.

#### Task 2
1. What is the distribution of the working population (main and marginal workers) by sector (cultivators, agricultural labourers, household industry, other workers) and gender across different states?
2. Plot a graph showing all these sectors together for top 5 states ranked by employment rate.
